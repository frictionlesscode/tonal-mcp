macro-mcp copied it first, see its own auth.py docstring) -- this module has
no garmin-specific logic in it.

    at all, an X-Forwarded-For header here can only have been set by that
    process (a public attacker can't bypass it to spoof the header
    directly), so it's safe to trust for real per-client separation. Falls
    back to the raw peer address if the header is absent (e.g. local testing
